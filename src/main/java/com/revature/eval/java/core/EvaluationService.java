	 * 19. Given a number determine whether or not it is valid per the Luhn formula.
	 * 
	 * The Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of
	 * identification numbers, such as credit card numbers and Canadian Social
	 * Insurance Numbers.
	 * 
	 * The task is to check if a given string is valid.
	 * 
	 * Validating a Number Strings of length 1 or less are not valid. Spaces are
	 * allowed in the input, but they should be stripped before checking. All other
	 * non-digit characters are disallowed.
	 * 
	 * Example 1: valid credit card number 1 4539 1488 0343 6467 The first step of
	 * the Luhn algorithm is to double every second digit, starting from the right.
	 * We will be doubling
	 * 
	 * 4_3_ 1_8_ 0_4_ 6_6_ If doubling the number results in a number greater than 9
	 * then subtract 9 from the product. The results of our doubling:
	 * 
	 * 8569 2478 0383 3437 Then sum all of the digits:
	 * 
	 * 8+5+6+9+2+4+7+8+0+3+8+3+3+4+3+7 = 80 If the sum is evenly divisible by 10,
	 * then the number is valid. This number is valid!
	 * 
	 * Example 2: invalid credit card number 1 8273 1232 7352 0569 Double the second
	 * digits, starting from the right
	 * 
	 * 7253 2262 5312 0539 Sum the digits
	 * 
	 * 7+2+5+3+2+2+6+2+5+3+1+2+0+5+3+9 = 57 57 is not evenly divisible by 10, so
	 * this number is not valid.
